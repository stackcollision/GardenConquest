# GardenConquest
A new game mode for [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/) that
provides players with additional PVP opportunities and helps admins limit grid
count and complexity.

## Gameplay Concepts

### Ship Classification
Each grid must have a special Hull Classifier beacon on it.  This block
requires a new component named "Ship License" to build. The larger the class,
the greater the number of licenses required.

Each faction is also permitted a limited number of "Unlicensed" grids
(default 2). An Unlicensed Hull Classifier is required even on these grids.
These classifiers do not require Ship Licenses to build, but they have
relatively low block limits.

Classifiers and their License cost (subject to change):

* Unlicensed - 0
* Fighter - 5
* Corvette - 10
* Utility - 15
* Frigate - 20
* Destroyer - 40
* Cruiser - 80
* Carrier - 100
* Battleship - 150

Until a Hull Classifier is built on a grid, or after a classifier is destroyed,
the grid becomes "Unclassified". This starts a timer (default 2 hours) until the
grid becomes a "Derelict." A Derelict is immediately disabled and eventually
destroyed. Players should classify their grids within the time limit to ensure
they are not damaged/removed.

#### Class-based block limits
Each class imposes limits on the number of various blocks on the grid,
i.e. turrets, as well as the total block count. Players are unable to add blocks
over the established limits for the grid's class. If a player changes a grid's
class and it is breaking the limits for the new class, no new blocks can be
added until the offending blocks are removed. Server owners can set specific
limits per class for certain grids. The defaults are (currently in flux):

* Fighter - 0 turrets,
* Corvette - 2 turrets,

...etc, will be filled out when these are more certain...

### Control Points
In order to acquire Ship Licenses, a faction must hold a Control Points ("CPs").
Every X minutes (default 15), a CP "round" will end and the CP's reward
of Y Ship Licenses (default 5) will be given to the faction with the most valid grids
within the CP's sphere of influence.

A grid is counted towards a faction's total if:
* It has a powered, broadcasting Hull Classifier beacon
* The broadcast range on the classifier is at least as large as the radius of
the CP (default 15km). This is to prevent players from hiding while capturing a
CP.

If there is a tie in grid counts between factions, no one gets the reward.

### Requirements

To develop SE Mods you will need:

* [Visual Studo](#)

If you're developing assets you may also need:

* A graphic editor like [Photoshop](#) for textures
* A way to export graphics to DDS for textures, i.e. [NVIDIA Texture Tools for Adobe Photoshop](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop)
* A 3d modeling program for models [Photoshop]
